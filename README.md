# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting loan approvals using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, employment status e.t.c The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature engineering. Various classification algorithms, including logistic regression,  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented and compared. 

The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project also explores feature scaling techniques and automated feature selection to enhance predictive accuracy.
