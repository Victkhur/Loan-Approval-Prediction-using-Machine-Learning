# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

## üìå Project Description 
This project focuses on predicting loan approvals using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, employment status e.t.c The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature engineering. Various classification algorithms, including logistic regression,  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented and compared. 

The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project also explores feature scaling techniques and automated feature selection to enhance predictive accuracy.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset contains 13 features : 
1. **Loan:**	A unique id
2. **Gender:**	Gender of the applicant Male/female
3. **Married:**	Marital Status of the applicant, values will be Yes/ No.
4. **Dependents:**	It tells whether the applicant has any dependents or not.
5. **Education:**	It will tell us whether the applicant is Graduated or not.
6. **Self_Employed:**	This defines that the applicant is self-employed i.e. Yes/ No.
7. **ApplicantIncome:**	Applicant income
8. **CoapplicantIncome:**	Co-applicant income
9. **LoanAmount:**	Loan amount (in thousands)
10. **Loan_Amount_Term:**	Terms of loan (in months)
11. **Credit_History:**	Credit history of individual‚Äôs repayment of their debts
12. **Property_Area:**	Area of property i.e. Rural/Urban/Semi-urban.
13. **Loan_Status:**	Status of Loan Approved or not i.e. Y- Yes, N-No.
